# User-Updater
As is it currently configured this script searches AD for all user accounts containing Test

Pulls the required data for each user and moves it into an Ordered Dictionary and then into an array (not entirely sure why it cant go straight to the array but it works...)

Write the array to a table (again can I take a step out of this process??)

Loop through each Result in the table > change Display name to Surname givenName and change title to Student - ID

Commented out section provides option to verify who will be edited. Please run this first.
